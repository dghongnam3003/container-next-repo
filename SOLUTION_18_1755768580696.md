# Issue Solution: ISSUE TYPE: styling

## Analysis Summary
ISSUE TYPE: styling
SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Set the background color of the entire page to a specific blue shade
COLORS IDENTIFIED:
- "blue" â†’ #0000FF
TARGET FILES:
- index.css (or equivalent global stylesheet)
IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
1. Locate the global stylesheet file (e.g., index.css, app.css, global.css) in the project.
2. Add a CSS rule to set the `background-color` property of the `body` element to the desired blue color:
```css
body {
  background-color: #0000FF;
}
```
3. Ensure the CSS rule is applied globally and takes precedence over any other background-color rules.
4. Test the change across different screen sizes and devices to ensure consistent blue background.
TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Consider using CSS variables to make the blue color easily customizable in the future.
- Ensure the blue background color provides sufficient contrast with the text and other UI elements for accessibility.
- Evaluate the impact of the blue background on the overall design and color scheme of the application.
