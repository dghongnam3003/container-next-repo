# User Registration Feature Implementation

Implemented a complete user registration feature with React components that includes comprehensive form validation, error handling, backend API integration, and accessibility best practices. The solution provides client-side validation for email format and password strength, integrates with a Next.js API route for user creation, and follows existing design patterns with proper Tailwind CSS styling.
