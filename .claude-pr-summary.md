# Change Website Background to Blue

Changed the website background color to blue for both light and dark modes as requested in issue #89. Updated the CSS custom properties in `src/app/globals.css` to use blue backgrounds (`#0066cc` for light mode and `#003d7a` for dark mode) instead of white/dark backgrounds, with white text for better readability.
