# Change Deploy Now Button Color to Yellow

Updated the "Deploy now" button in `src/app/page.tsx` to use yellow background color (`bg-yellow-500`) with darker yellow hover states (`hover:bg-yellow-600`) for both light and dark modes. The button text color was changed to black (`text-black`) to ensure proper contrast and readability against the yellow background.
