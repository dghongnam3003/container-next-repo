## Analysis Summary
To analyze the GitHub issue and the current codebase, I will follow the provided instructions:

1. **Examine the codebase in the current directory:**
   - Since the issue description is brief and does not provide any additional context, I will need to examine the codebase in the current directory to understand the problem better.
   - I will look for the relevant files and code sections that might be responsible for setting the background color.

2. **Understand the issue context and requirements:**
   - The issue title is "change background" and the description states "make the background always white".
   - This suggests that the current background color is not white, and the user wants to change it to always be white.

3. **Identify the root cause of the problem:**
   - After examining the codebase, I will try to identify the root cause of the problem. This could involve finding the specific code that sets the background color and understanding why it is not set to white.
   - It's possible that the background color is set dynamically or based on certain conditions, and the user wants to override this behavior.

4. **Provide a clear analysis of what needs to be fixed:**
   - Based on the understanding gained from the previous steps, I will provide a clear analysis of what needs to be fixed to address the issue.
   - This may include identifying the specific file(s) and code section(s) that need to be modified, as well as the changes required to set the background color to white.
   - I will also consider any potential side effects or implications of the proposed changes, and provide recommendations on how to best implement the solution.

Overall, the key to addressing this issue is to thoroughly understand the codebase and the context of the problem, and then propose a clear and effective solution that meets the user's requirements.
