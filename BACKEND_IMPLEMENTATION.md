- security
- integration

## Implementation Approach:
Security-focused implementation

## Architecture Overview:
- RESTful API design with clear endpoint structure
- Layered architecture (Routes → Controllers → Services → Models)
- Proper error handling and validation
- Security best practices implementation
- Performance optimization with caching

## Security Measures:
- Authentication using JWT tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Security headers and CORS configuration

## Performance Optimizations:
